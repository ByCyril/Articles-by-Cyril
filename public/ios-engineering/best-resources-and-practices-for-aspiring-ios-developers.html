            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              The vast amount of content and resources within the iOS
              Development community, has made this specialty the easiest and the
              most welcoming for beginners who want to pursue a career in
              Computer Science or just as a hobby. The only question is how and
              where do you start? As a self-taught developer, my experience can
              help answer this question with the resources I’m using and some of
              the best practices I follow that has helped me mature in Software
              Development.
            </p>

            <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
            <h3>AppCoda</h3>
            <p>
              AppCoda is a medium for iOS Developers to share tutorials and step
              by step instructions on anything related to iOS Development.
              Articles can range from simple tips such as how to customize your
              navigation bars to machine learning topics related to iOS. Some
              topics I’ve learned from this site include how to get started with
              CoreML, generating your own CoreML models, and a taste on how to
              use ARKit.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you browse through their library, take note of the published
              date (as you always should when reading an article) because some
              articles may be outdated due to updates in Swift and iOS. Aside
              from that, their library can serve a wide range of audiences from
              different levels of experiences; which has made me recommend this
              site to a number of people.
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.appcoda.com/swift/">View site here</a>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>HackingWithSwift</h3>
            <p>
              HackingWithSwift is authored by Paul Hudson; a well respected
              figure within the iOS Developer community. His content ranges from
              snippets of Swift examples, step by step tutorials, to books for
              beginners to advanced.
            </p>
            <p>
              My favorite part of this website is the Swift examples section,
              where I use it as a substitute for Apples Official Documentations,
              for its simplicity and beginner friendly explanations and
              examples. With that being said, I would recommend this to anyone
              especially if you are early in your iOS Development careers.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h3>LetsBuildThatApp</h3>
            <p>
              LetsBuildThatApp is a YouTube channel owned by Brian Vong. Here
              you will get in-depth tutorials from creating specific features,
              fundamental programming topics, to building a whole app from the
              ground up. A lot of my development habits are largely influenced
              by Brian’s style of coding. This was also where I first learned
              about Firebase database and developing user interfaces
              programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              While he provides a plethora of valuable content, his videos are a
              bit too lengthy for my attention span and does require a lot of
              patients. He also teaches everything in code without using the
              storyboard; which I could image would intimidate many beginners.
              However, if you take the time to go through at least one of his
              tutorial series on building a whole app, you should be able to
              quickly follow his other videos much quicker.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that being said, I would strongly recommend this channel for
              developers who have at least some basic understanding of the Swift
              programming language and basic UIKit fundamentals.
            </p>

            <h3>Sean Allen</h3>
            <p>
              Sean Allen on YouTube takes you along his journey as an iOS
              Engineer, with a a unique variety of content that serves most if
              not all levels of experiences to his audience. From the time of
              this article, Sean is pushing out beginner content that I highly
              recommend every beginner should look at. His older videos consist
              of iOS interview challenges, basic iOS concepts, as well as career
              advices. He also hosts Swift News, a weekly show where he curates
              topics related to iOS Development, to keep the community informed
              with industry changes, discoveries, and unique ideas. If you are a
              seasoned developer, you would understand the value this would
              bring you.
            </p>
            <p>
              His teaching style is also very unique compared to others that
              I’ve mentioned in this list. He is fast and straight to the point
              while effectively explaining all important details of the subject.
              With that being said, if you share the same learning style as me
              (short attention spans, likes things to be quick and fast), this
              is the right channel for you. If you are a seasoned developer,
              Swift News is a gem!
            </p>

            <h3>Brian Advent</h3>
            <p>
              Brian Advent’s YouTube channel is by far my favorite learning
              channel for iOS. He touches on topics that other channels usually
              don’t teach such as creating a handwriting recognition app,
              building a 3D game with SceneKit, how to use RxSwift, testing beta
              technologies like ARKit 2, and many more.
            </p>
            <p>
              He also pushes out design development tutorials which is a
              separate skill in and of itself. I see a lot of aspiring
              developers that would switch their focus from app development to
              app design; under the impression that it would be easier than app
              development. It’s one thing to think of a unique and elegant
              design pattern which challenges your creativity, but it’s another
              to actually implement it in code which challenges your technical
              ability.
            </p>
            <p>
              I haven’t seen any other channel or medium that touches on a wide
              array of iOS Development topics as well as app design tutorials.
              His style of code is reasonably basic that is easy to understand
              and follow as well as his in-depth explanations. With that being
              said, I highly recommend this channel to almost everyone.

            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <p>
              The resources provided above is just the first step to start your
              journey as an iOS Developer. Now, I want to share some of the best
              practices you should follow in order to be successful in your
              journey.
            </p>
            <h3>Connecting the Dots</h3>
            <p>
              Your journey as an iOS Developer will consist of head-scratching
              errors and mysterious bugs. Luckily for us, the internet is our
              best tool to get over through these hurtles.
              <b
                >In many cases, a single problem may require more than just a
                single Google search.</b
              >
              When you are stuck, break up the problem into smaller bits and
              gain a basic theoretical understanding of what you are doing and
              what each component of your code does. This way, you can make
              smaller searches on smaller components of your problem that are
              likely to be available on the internet.
            </p>
            <h3>NEVER Delete old Projects</h3>
            <p>
              This might sound weird to most people, but I always refer to old
              projects for snippets of code that could help me with a current
              project. You may have already solved a problem, why spend time on
              a problem you’ve already solved? Any kind of project that you do
              is worth keeping for future reference because it a document of a
              solution you’ve made at a point in time.
            </p>
            <p>
              It might also be a good idea to store them in a GitHub account;
              where you can start to build your portfolio. As you continue to
              commit and create new repos, it can provide a sense of
              accomplishment with a boost of encouragement when hard times come.
              This is also one of the best ways you can contribute back to the
              community.
            </p>
            <h3>Contribute</h3>
            <p>
              To contribute means but not limited to share what you’ve learned
              by answering questions on StackOverflow, writing tutorials of your
              own, or even sharing your own code. Not only will your
              contributions help other developers, but its the best way to
              motivate yourself to learn and to be curious. It also forces you
              to write good clear code that would challenge how well you
              understand the topic you are sharing. This is exactly what I am
              trying to do for 2019!
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Developing and publishing your first iOS application is probably
              the most rewarding feeling you could do with very little physical
              resources. All you need is a laptop and a good internet connection
              to get started. The plethora of resources out there along with the
              best practices I’ve listed above, should be enough to get you the
              momentum you need to get started and to succeed. All it takes is
              for you to take the first step and commit the time and resources
              to begin.
